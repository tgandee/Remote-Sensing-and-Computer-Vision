# Remote Sensing and Computer Vision

This project contains all Jupyter (executed in Colab) notebooks, assignments, and projects for Dr. Xianglong's course on Remote Sensing & Computer Vision, offered Fall 2022.

## Author's note

Keep in mind all of these projects (as of 03/07/2023) were created as assignments and may be improved upon through other techniques not touched on. These notebooks should provide an overview of algorithms used to manipulate imaging and sensing data, while also including image transformations and image stitching using OpenCV. There is also a slight touch on Pytorch to build an image classification model from scratch using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Name
Assignments from Remote Sensing and Computer Vision at Miami University, an exclusively-graduate course taught by Dr. Xianglong Feng in Fall 2022.

## Installation
All notebooks may be executed through Colab, though not all images exist in the repository. Furthermore, if you are running anything using Pytorch, it is best to attach a GPU to the kernel

In Google Colab, go to: Settings -> Change Runtime Type -> Hardware Accelerator -> Select GPU

## Support
For any questions you may email me at gandeetj@miamioh.edu

## Roadmap
An individual project is in the works to train a cascade classifier on a first-person-shooter (FPS) game to deploy a machine-learning-based aiming assist tool. ML-based aimbots are becoming increasingly popular, and significantly harder to detect than data-mining aimbots. In order to understand how to defend against such aimbots, we look to understanding how these classifiers run in real-time alongside the video game.

## Authors and acknowledgment
All assignments were created by Dr. Feng, while solutions are my own.

## Project status
The overall coursework is complete, however this project may be the location for the future cascade classifier.
